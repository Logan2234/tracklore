// Generic Svelte action: moves the node to `document.body` on mount. Used by
// fixed-position overlays (Drawer, FocusOverlay) so their `position: fixed`
// is always relative to the viewport — otherwise a `fixed` descendant
// inherits whatever containing block its parent tree happens to establish
// (any ancestor with a CSS transform/filter/etc.), which on a tall page
// misplaces and mis-sizes the element relative to the *document* instead of
// the screen. Portaling to <body> sidesteps the whole class of bug.
export function portal(node: HTMLElement) {
  document.body.appendChild(node);

  // No destroy(): Svelte detaches `node` from wherever it currently lives
  // (body) once its outro finishes. Moving it back to its original slot here
  // would race that teardown — the node re-appears in the component tree
  // *after* Svelte already destroyed its reactivity/handlers for it, leaving
  // a dead, unclickable remnant behind (confirmed live: closing a Drawer left
  // its content stuck on screen).
